All API routes are using the dedicated sub domain `api.lemlist.com`.

lemlist uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get your lemlist API key at our [integration page](https://app.lemlist.com/settings/integrations).

You need to add the `Authorization` header using the `Basic` authentication type. `login:password` **where the login is always empty and the password is the API key**.

Or pass your API key as a query parameter `access_token`

⚠️ **Don't forget to add the semicolon (**`:`**) before your API key in curl command.**

> To authorize, use this code: 
  

``` shell
curl https://api.lemlist.com/api/team \
  --user ":YourApiKey"

 ```

> Or 
  

``` shell
curl https://api.lemlist.com/api/team?access_token=YourApiKey

 ```

**Make sure to replace** **`YourApiKey`** **with your API key.**
