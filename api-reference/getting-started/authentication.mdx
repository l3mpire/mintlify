## HEADS-UP BASIC AUTH (NOT BEARER)
<span style={{ color: '#ff8080', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>We use BASIC authentication NOT bearer.</span> Confusing, we know. Read on.

This trips up a lot of users, so let's be explicit:
- You must use HTTP **BASIC** authentication (more [below](#authenticate)).
- The *login* (username) is **always empty**.
- The *password* is **your API key**.
- <span style={{ color: '#ff8080', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>THERE IS A COLON</span> before your API key.

Read on to learn:
- how to grab your API key
- how to authenticate


## Grab your API key

1. head over to [lemlist](https://app.lemlist.com)
2. click on your profile picture in the bottom left-hand corner and click on *Settings*
3. go to the *Integrations* tab
4. click on *Generate a new API key*
5. store it securely because **you won't be able to see it again**

> Of course, never - ever - share your API key. Treat it like a password.


## Authenticate

Basic authentication involves sending a verified username (**empty**, in our case) and password (your API key) with all requests.

But not just like that.

They must be **Base64 encoded** and passed in the Authorization header of all your requests.

Step by step, this is how to authenticate to our API:
1. you get an API key (cf. [above](#grab-your-api-key))
2. you build the string `:YourApiKey` (YES, colon at the start)
3. you Base64 encode that `:YourApiKey` string ([this is how in Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/toBase64))
4. you pass the encoded result in the Authorization header of all requests with the prefix "Basic ".

In the end, a curl request to any `endpoint` in the API will look similar to this:
```curl
curl --location 'https://api.lemlist.com/api/{endpoint}' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic {the base64-encoded stuff from step 3}'
```
