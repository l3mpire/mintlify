There are two ways you can do to give us feedback on our API and developer docs:
1. Use this [form](https://lemlist.typeform.com/to/mfVlkyGf) if you want to give detailed feedback (that's our preferred solution)
2. Use the thumbs up and down you'll see on every page of the reference for quicker on-the-fly feedback
