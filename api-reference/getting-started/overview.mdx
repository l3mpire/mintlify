## Welcome to the lemlist API reference 🎉
Looking to integrate lemlist with other tools? Automate some of your outreach away?

You're in the right place.

## API URL

All API routes live at `https://api.lemlist.com/api`.

So, for every `endpoint` documented in this reference, the full URL is `https://api.lemlist.com/api/{endpoint}`.

## Outline
The API reference is part of the larger *developer docs*, divided into 2 main sections:
- *User Guides*: tutorials that leverage the API reference
- *API Reference* (👈 **you're here**): every technical detail about the API 

And the API reference itself is divided into 3 main sections:
- *Getting Started* (👈 **you're here**): everything you need to know before using the API (authentication, rate limits, etc.)
- *Endpoints*: the different endpoints available in the API, to actually get things done
- *Objects & Definitions*: the different objects, their definitions and what they mean (whether in lemlist's product or its API)

## How to read the API reference
I'd say:
1. skim through the *Getting Started* section (special attention on Authentication - it's tricky)
2. fast-forward to the API endpoints that seem relevant to you
3. **if need be**, check the objects referenced in those endpoints to understand what they mean
