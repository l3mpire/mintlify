## Stay within bounds

> The rate limits are **20 requests per 2 seconds**.

To make sure everyone gets a fair and seemless use of our services, we apply rate limits to our API:
- on **all routes**
- for **each API key** separately

## Know where you stand

The responses of all queries provide will tell you where you stand with your rate limits. More specifically, you'll always have the following headers:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Retry-After` | The number of seconds in which you can retry |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum requests in that time |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of remaining requests you can make |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The date when the rate limit will reset |

And here's a concrete example of what they could look like:
```json
{
    "Retry-After": 2,
    "X-RateLimit-Limit": 20,
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining": 7,
    "X-RateLimit-Reset": "Tue Feb 16 2021 09:02:42 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)"
}
```

> Pay special attention to the human-readable date format of `X-RateLimit-Reset`.
