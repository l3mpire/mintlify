## Use v2

There are two API versions:
- v1: which is deprecated - <span style={{ color: '#ff8080', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>do not use it</span>
- v2: **use this one**

Problem is that the default version in our API is still v1 for *some* endpoints (we're working on a better solution as i type).

For such endpoints - like [GET Many Campaigns](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/endpoints/campaigns/retrieve-campaigns) - you'll have to explicitly specify that you want to use v2 by adding `version=v2` in your query parameters.

> We will remind you of this throughout the docs.
