<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Webhook" objectPath="webhook" />

Create a webhook that receives real-time POST callbacks at your URL when selected events occur.

## What you can subscribe to

- Activities by type (e.g., emailsSent, emailsOpened, emailsReplied, linkedinInterested). See the full list in the API reference for this endpointâ€™s request body.
- Operational alerts (e.g., customDomainErrors, connectionIssue, sendLimitReached, lemwarmPaused, campaignComplete).

Optionally, you can scope a webhook to a single campaign and/or only trigger it the first time an event happens.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```json all events
{
	"targetUrl": "https://webhook.site/your-id"
}
```

```json specific event and campaign
{
	"targetUrl": "https://webhook.site/your-id",
	"type": "linkedinInterested",
	"campaignId": "cam_A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9",
	"isFirst": true
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Tip: You can include an optional `zapId` if you use Zapier to track the webhook mapping on your side.
