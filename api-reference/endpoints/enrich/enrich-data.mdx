title: Enrich Data
openapi: post /enrich
---

This endpoint allows you to [enrich](/api-reference/objects-definitions/enrich) data by providing inputs such as email, LinkedIn URL, or other information.

## Using the endpoint

The enrichment API provides the ability to request data (email, phone number, LinkedIn information) in multiple ways:

- Given some input (email, LinkedIn URL, etc.) for a single enrichment
- Bulk inputs that process many data points at once

All enrichment APIs are asynchronous. There are two ways to retrieve your enriched data:

1. Call the GET endpoint with the `enrichmentId` that was provided
2. Use webhooks to receive notifications when enrichment is complete
