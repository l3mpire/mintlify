openapi: "get /campaigns/{campaignId}/export/leads"
description: "Exports leads from a campaign with flexible filtering and format options."
---

The export returns leads in CSV or JSON format based on their state.

## Filtering by state

Use the `state` parameter to filter leads by their current status. You can:

- Export all leads: `state=all`
- Filter by specific states: `state=emailsOpened,emailsReplied`
- Use multiple states: `state=interested,warmed`

### Global states

These group multiple lead states into a single category:

| State                | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `imported`           | Leads imported without processing (not scanned, no steps sent, not reviewed) |
| `scanned`            | Leads scanned by LinkedIn or email verification                              |
| `skipped`            | Leads skipped during review                                                  |
| `reviewed`           | Leads that were reviewed                                                     |

<Tip>
  Use global states like `hooked` or `warmed` to quickly segment leads by engagement level, or use detailed states for precise filtering based on specific actions.
