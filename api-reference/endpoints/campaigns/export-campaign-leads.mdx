openapi: get /campaigns/{campaignId}/export/leads
---

This endpoint exports leads from a campaign with filtering options. The export returns leads in CSV or JSON format based on their state.

## Filtering by state

Use the `state` parameter to filter leads by their current status. You can:
- Export all leads: `state=all`
- Filter by specific states: `state=emailsOpened,emailsReplied`
- Use multiple states: `state=interested,warmed`

### Global states

These group multiple lead states into a single category:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `imported` | Leads imported without processing (not scanned, no steps sent, not reviewed) |
| `scanned` | Leads scanned by LinkedIn or email verification |
| `skipped` | Leads skipped during review |
| `reviewed` | Leads that were reviewed |
| `contacted` | Leads that were contacted (at least one step executed, no response yet) |
| `hooked` | Leads that opened an email or LinkedIn message |
| `attracted` | Leads that clicked in an email or accepted a LinkedIn invite |
| `warmed` | Leads that replied to an email or LinkedIn message |
| `interested` | Leads marked as interested |
| `notInterested` | Leads marked as not interested |
| `emailsBounced` | Leads where at least one step bounced or failed |
| `emailsUnsubscribed` | Leads that unsubscribed |
| `meetingBooked` | Leads that booked a meeting |
| `paused` | Leads that were paused |

### Detailed states

For more granular filtering:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `emailsSent` | Email was sent |
| `emailsOpened` | Lead opened an email |
| `emailsClicked` | Lead clicked on an email |
| `emailsReplied` | Lead replied to an email |
| `emailsInterested` | Lead marked as success via email |
| `emailsNotInterested` | Lead marked as not a success via email |
| `emailsFailed` | Error sending email |
| `linkedinVisitDone` | LinkedIn profile was visited |
| `linkedinInviteDone` | LinkedIn invitation was sent |
| `linkedinInviteAccepted` | LinkedIn invitation was accepted |
| `linkedinSent` | LinkedIn message was sent |
| `linkedinOpened` | LinkedIn message was opened |
| `linkedinReplied` | Lead replied on LinkedIn |
| `linkedinInterested` | Lead marked as success via LinkedIn |
| `linkedinNotInterested` | Lead marked as not a success via LinkedIn |

## Output format

- **`csv`** (default): Returns a CSV file suitable for Excel, Google Sheets, etc.
- **`json`**: Returns structured JSON data for programmatic processing
