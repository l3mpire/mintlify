<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Report" objectPath="report" />

This endpoint retrieves aggregated reports for one or multiple campaigns. It provides a convenient way to get export status and statistics across multiple campaigns in a single request.

## Multiple campaigns

Pass multiple campaign IDs as a comma-separated list in the `campaignIds` parameter:

```bash
https://api.lemlist.com/api/campaigns/reports?campaignIds=cam_123,cam_456,cam_789
```

## Response structure

The response includes export status information similar to the [Get Campaign Export Status](/api-reference/endpoints/campaigns/get-campaign-export-status) endpoint, but can aggregate data across multiple campaigns.

## Use cases

This endpoint is particularly useful for:
- **Dashboard views**: Get stats for multiple campaigns at once
- **Portfolio reporting**: Monitor performance across several outreach campaigns
- **Batch processing**: Check export status for multiple campaigns initiated earlier

<Tip>
This is more efficient than calling individual campaign endpoints when you need data from multiple campaigns.
