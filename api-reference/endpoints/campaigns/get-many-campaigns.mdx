<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Campaign" objectPath="campaign" />

This endpoint retrieves the list of all campaigns.

<Note>
There are two versions of this route:

- **v1 (default)**: Returns an array of campaigns based on the parameters given.
- **v2**: Designed for pagination. It returns an array of campaigns and pagination information to help you easily navigate through the entire list if you have more than 100 elements.

See the provided examples for more details.
</Note>

<Warning>
We recommend migrating to v2 before the end of 2024 with the query parameter `version=v2`, after which v1 will be discontinued.
