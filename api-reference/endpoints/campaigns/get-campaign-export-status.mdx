openapi: get /campaigns/{campaignId}/export/{exportId}/status
---

This endpoint checks the status of an asynchronous campaign export initiated with the [Start Campaign Stats Export](/api-reference/endpoints/campaigns/start-campaign-export) endpoint.

## Status values

The `status` field in the response can be:
- **`pending`**: The export is still being processed
- **`done`**: The export is complete and ready to download
- **`error`**: An error occurred during the export

## Expiration times

<Warning>
- **Status availability**: Export statuses are available for **2 hours only**. An export still pending after 2 hours will be considered failed and return a 404 error.
- **File availability**: Once you obtain the CSV file URL, you must download it within **24 hours**. After that, the file will be deleted.
</Warning>

## Polling strategy

Check the status periodically until you receive a status other than `"pending"`. We recommend:
- Starting with a 5-second interval
- Increasing to 10-15 seconds for longer exports
- Stopping immediately when status is `"done"` or `"error"`

## Download URL

When the status is `"done"`, the response will include a `url` field containing the download link for the CSV file.
