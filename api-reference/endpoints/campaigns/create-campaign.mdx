<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Campaign" objectPath="campaign" />

This endpoint creates a new campaign.

When you create a new campaign, an empty sequence and default schedule are automatically added. You can specify a name, or one will be assigned by default. 

The returned data includes the campaign, sequence, and schedule IDs, which you can use later to update campaign settings, add sequence steps, or modify the schedule.
