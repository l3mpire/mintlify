<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Lead" objectPath="lead" />

This endpoint deletes a lead from a campaign.

You need to specify `action=remove` in the params to delete a lead. If you don't specify `action=remove`, the endpoint fallbacks to unsubscribing the lead and to do so you need to provide the lead email.
