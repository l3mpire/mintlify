<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Lead" objectPath="lead" />

This endpoint deletes a lead from a campaign.

## Fallback behavior

If you don't specify `'action': 'remove'` in the request body, the endpoint falls back to an `'unsubscribe'` action. When using the unsubscribe action, you must provide the lead's email address to unsubscribe them.
