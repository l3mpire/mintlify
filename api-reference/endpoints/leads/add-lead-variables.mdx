openapi: post /leads/{leadId}/variables
---

This endpoint lets you add new variables to a lead. To do so, you can add as many custom fields as you want in the body of your request with the desired value for these **new** fields.

<Warning>
 The purpose of this endpoint is only to create new variables, even though we have to give them specific values on a specific lead. That's why you'll get errors if you give variable names that already exist on a lead.

 By default, lemlist includes several variables related to leads: `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `picture`, `phone`, `linkedinUrl`, `companyName`, `companyDomain`, and `icebreaker`.
 
 Beware, you **cannot** add a new variable with the same name as an existing (default) variable either.
</Warning>

<Info>
    Then, if you want to modify the values **within** these new custom variables, simply use the [Update Lead](./update-lead) endpoint.
