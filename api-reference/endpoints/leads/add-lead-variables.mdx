Add custom variables to a lead. Variables are passed as query parameters.

<Note>
By default, lemlist includes several variables related to leads: `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `picture`, `phone`, `linkedinUrl`, `companyName`, `companyDomain`, and `icebreaker`.

These variables can be used to personalize and enhance your outreach campaigns effectively.

<Warning>
You cannot add a new variable with the same name as an existing default variable.
