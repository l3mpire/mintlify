openapi: post /leads/{leadId}/variables
description: Adds new custom variables to a lead.
---

To add custom fields, you can add as many as you want in the body of your request with the desired value for these **new** fields.

<Warning>
 The purpose of this endpoint is first and foremost to create new variables, even though we have to give them specific values on a specific lead. That's why you'll get errors if you give variable names that already exist on a lead.

 By default, lemlist includes several variables related to leads: `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `picture`, `phone`, `linkedinUrl`, `companyName`, `companyDomain`, and `icebreaker`.
 
 Beware, you **cannot** add a new variable with the same name as an existing variable (default or custom).
