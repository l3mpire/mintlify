<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Lead" objectPath="lead" />

This endpoint retrieves a lead by their email address.

<Note>
There are two versions of this route:

- **v1 (default)**: Returns an object containing the first lead found. **This version is deprecated**.
- **v2**: Returns an array of objects with all leads matching the searched email address. The structure of each lead object in v2 has been enhanced to provide more information.

See the provided examples for more details.
</Note>

<Warning>
We recommend migrating to v2 before the end of 2024 with the query parameter `version=v2`, after which v1 will be discontinued.
</Warning>
