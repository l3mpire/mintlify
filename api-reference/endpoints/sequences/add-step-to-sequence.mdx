description: Creates a step or condition within a campaign sequence.

import {SnippetObjectReference} from '/snippets/snippet-object-reference.jsx'

<SnippetObjectReference objectName="Sequence" objectPath="sequence" />

If you want to get the main sequence or a list of sequences for a campaign, you can call `/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/sequences`.

## Adding Steps

To add a new step to a sequence, call the API with the sequence ID in the parameters and the step details in the request body.

For example, adding a LinkedIn invite step:

```json
{
    "type": "linkedinInvite",
    "message": "Invite message...."
}
```

## Adding Conditions

To add a condition to a sequence, you must provide the `conditionKey` and type `conditional` along with the required fields. The API will return a condition with an array of condition sequences, where you can call the same API again to add steps to those sequences.

For example, creating a LinkedIn invite condition:

```json
{
    "type": "conditional",
    "conditionKey": "linkedinInviteAccepted",
    "delayType": "waitUntil"
}
```

This will return:

```json
{
    "_id": "stp_Ae93hiemDkypHLys2",
    "type": "conditional",
    "conditions": [
        {
            "sequenceId": "seq_jacL5GNH3YpNnuNQ2",
            "label": "Accepted invite",
            "key": "linkedinInviteAccepted",
            "delay": 1,
            "delayType": "waitUntil"
        },
        {
            "sequenceId": "seq_xzrGLxhZwoo5oxukc",
            "fallback": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Then you can call `/api/sequences/seq_jacL5GNH3YpNnuNQ2/steps` to add a send step if the invite is accepted:

```json
{
    "type": "linkedinSend",
    "message": "Hello, ..."
}
```

## Step Types and Required Fields

The table below summarizes the required and optional fields for each step type. Note that all step requests must include a common `type` field.

| Step Type | Required Fields | Optional Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | `subject`, `message` | `index`, `delay` |
| `manual` | `title` | `message`, `index`, `delay` |
| `phone` | - | `message`, `index`, `delay` |
| `api` | `method`, `url` | `index`, `delay` |
| `linkedinVisit` | - | `index`, `delay` |
| `linkedinInvite` | - | `message`, `index`, `delay` |
| `linkedinSend` | `message` | `altMessage`, `index`, `delay` |
| `sendToAnotherCampaign` | `campaignId` | `index`, `delay` |
| `conditional` | `conditionKey`, `delayType` (and `delay` when `delayType` is `within`) | `index` |
| `whatsappMessage` | `message` | `index`, `delay` |

<Note>
In conditional steps, if the `delayType` is not `"within"`, the `delay` field is not required.
