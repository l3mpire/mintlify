# What you'll learn in this guide

How to:

- Fetch filtered campaigns automatically with the lemlist API on a daily basis
- Fetch the statistics of those campaigns
- Put them in a Google Sheet for visualisation and sharing

# Imagine…

You’re an outbound agency sending tens of campaigns on behalf of your clients.

You want a way to:

1. share campaign performances with them automatically
2. and without them knowing about the performances of campaigns that are not theirs

If you had a workflow that could export all campaign statistics, maybe filter out a few of them, and drop them in a dedicated Google Sheet, you’d only need sharing the GSheet with your client.

Ultimately, you could build your own charts in Google Sheet: select only the metrics you care about, customize the colors to fit their brand, etc.

# Sync relevant campaign stats with GSheet on a daily basis

## Overview

> “What’s a relevant campaign?”

I’d say it depends on your situation, but it could be a campaign:
- that’s running or ended
- that has a specific word in its title (like the name of the client you want to build the report for)
- that’s been created less than a year ago
- you name it

In our case, we will get only the 100 most recent ended campaigns that don’t have errors.

> “I’ve read ‘automation’ and ‘automatically’ a lot since the beginning of this guide, but how? With what tool?

Again, like in all other guides: [n8n](https://n8n.io/) — my favourite! But you could definitely use another one like Make or Zapier.

## Fetching relevant campaigns on a daily basis

<SnippetLemlistN8nIntegration />

Here’s how:

1. Head over to n8n, create a new workflow, and drop a "Schedule" trigger configured to run once a day, at the end of the day (once all emails of the day have been sent):
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/scheduleTrigger.png" alt="schedule trigger configuration" />
    </Frame>
2. Then add the lemlist node "Get many campaigns" to fetch literally **all** campaigns in your workspace (we'll filter them afterwards), like so:
    <SnippetVideoFrame
        src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/fetchAllCampaigns.mp4"
        caption="Click on 'execute the node' and pin the results." />
3. Chain a "Filter" node to your workflow and apply all the filters that make sense for your use case. Here are mine for instance:
    <Frame caption="I want un-archived campaigns, without errors, that have finished and that have been created in the past three years. That's how.">
        <img src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/filterCampaignsNode.png" alt="filter node configuration" />
    </Frame>

## Fetching relevant campaign statistics

At the previous step, we fetched relevant campaigns, now it’s time to get their stats:

1. Chain the lemlist node "Get campaign stats" and configure it to retrieve the stats of the input campaigns from their creation dates to today:
    <SnippetVideoFrame
        src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/getCampaignStatsNode.mp4"
        caption="get campaign stats node configuration" />
2. Once configured, execute the node and pin the results. Ultimately, the node should look like this:
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/campaignStatsOutput.png" alt="campaign stats node result" />
    </Frame>
    However, with just the results of the node, we lost the info about the corresponding campaign. Which is why we are not done just yet…
3. Chain a "Merge" node to the workflow like so:
    <SnippetVideoFrame
        src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/mergeInputAndOutput.mp4"
        caption="Configure it to merge items based on position." />
    <Frame caption="And you'll see in the output that the stats have been merged with the input campaign details.">
        <img src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/mergedOutput.png" alt="merged stats output" />
    </Frame>
    Don't forget to pin everything and move on.
    

## Drop results in the Google Sheet

1. First, create a blank Google Sheet somewhere in Google Drive and make sure n8n has access to it (here's [the doc](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets) if not) and add headers to the sheet. You need to add them manually beforehand, like this:
    <SnippetVideoFrame
        src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/copyPasteHeaders.mp4"
        caption="cmd+shit+v to paste without formatting, then copy and then special paste the transposed array." />
2. Then, add a "Append or update Sheet" Google Sheet node to the workflow.
    > “Wait, why *update*?”
    Because, i'm assuming that you only want the most up-to-date stats in your Google Sheet. If not though, you would simply append results to your Google Sheet and timestamp them.
    It's up to you, but from there, i'll assume that you only want the most recent data and hence, need to update rows in your spreadsheet (that's why i had you enter sheet headers manually beforehand by the way).
    
    <SnippetVideoFrame
        src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/upsertRowInSheet.mp4"
        caption="upsert row in Google Sheet" />

    Ultimately, this is what your node configuration looks like (when you map columns automatically, which i suggest you do, thanks to the preparation of your spreadsheet at the previous step):
    <Frame caption="The matching column is obviously 'id_' i.e. your campaign id.">
        <img src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/updateRowsInSheetConfig.png" alt="node configuration with matching column" />
    </Frame>
3. Now click on "execute workflow" one last time and make sure that your spreadsheet gets updated as intended.
    <Frame caption="It should look like this ultimately.">
        <img src="/images/guides/syncing-your-lemlist-campaign-stats-with-a-google-sheet/finalisedWorkflow.png" alt="final Google Sheet with campaign stats" />
    </Frame>
4. Wait, you know what?
    Run it even a second time, and make sure that your spreadsheet actually got updated, and that you didn’t append rows at the end of the sheet ;) If not, congrats: activate your workflow and you’re good to go!
    

# That's all folks!

Anyway, i hope you found this guide useful and that you see how it could be tweaked a million ways to perfectly fit your needs (by filtering campaigns differently, by putting the data in different sheets, by appending rows instead of updating them, etc.).

Now, i suggest you check this other guide: <a href="/guides/send-slack-notification-upon-lead-positive-reply">**Send Slack notification upon lead positive reply**</a>. It's very helpful too, should you want to warn your clients/employees in Slack directly when they get positive replies.
